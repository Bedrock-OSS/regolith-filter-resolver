# Regolith Filter Resolver
This repository contains the default filter resolver for [Regolith](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith). It is used to enable installing Regolith filters using their short names instead of full URLs. You can read more about resolvers in Regolith documentation.

## Adding Your Filters to the Resolver
You can add your own filters to the resolver by creating a pull request to this repository that adds your repository URL to the `repos.json` file. This will mark your repository as a known filter repository, and add all filters from there to the resolver.

## Known Repositories
You can use this list to discover new filters to use with Regolith, below you can find a list of known standard filters (from Bedrock-OSS) and community filters.
## Standard Filters

This list contains filters maintained by Bedrock-OSS.

| Filter | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [blockbench_convert](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/HEAD/blockbench_convert) | Converts blockbench models into `.geometry.json` files. |
| [bump_manifest](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/HEAD/bump_manifest) | Bumps the manifest version in your RP and BP. Good for multiplayer testing where you need to avoid pack-caching issues. |
| [filter_tester](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/HEAD/filter_tester) | Meant to be used by the filter developers to test other filters. It compares the expected results with the files generated by Regolith. |
| [fix_emissive](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/HEAD/fix_emissive) | Fixes emissive issues in your textures, by removing the color data from fully transparent pixels. |
| [gametests](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/HEAD/gametests) | Compiles gametests into pack. |
| [json_cleaner](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/HEAD/json_cleaner) | Removes comments from all json files in the project. Useful, since some filters cannot understand files with comments. |
| [json_convert](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/HEAD/json_convert) | Converts JSON5 and Hjson files into standard JSON files. |
| [name_ninja](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/HEAD/name_ninja) | Automatically generates entity, block, spawn egg, and item names, based on a custom 'name' field, or on the entities identifier. |

| [texture_list](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/HEAD/texture_list) | Automatically creates the `texture_list.json` file, based on the images you've added into your resource pack. |
| [type_gen](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/HEAD/type_gen) | Generates Files.d.ts file with some relevant constants from the current pack. |
